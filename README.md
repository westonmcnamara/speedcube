# Input
Input in SpeedCube is simple and straightforward.

Switch Lanes: A/D | Left/Right Arrows <br/>
Restart Game After Death: Space <br/>
Main Menu: Escape <br/>

If you know a cheat code, do this to trigger it.

1. Start a new game. Cheat codes can be inputted in the death screen or during a game. Not through the main menu.
2. Hold down each key of the code simultaniously. Timing, order and other parameters are irrelevant. If a codes corresponding buttons are pressed simultaniously, it will activate.

NOTE: Cheat codes last for as long as you play the game. When the application is closed, you will have to re-enter them the next time you play.
